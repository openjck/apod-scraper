NASA now has an API for this data which I recommend using instead. To use it,
[sign up for a key](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key) and
then check out [their documentation](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod).
There's also a number of [node modules](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=apod)
that wrap the API.
